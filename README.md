# LeetCode-Challenges-Python

## Approaching a problem/challenge when you're in an interview

- From Fullstack's videos on [Whiteboard Coding Interviews: 6 Steps to Solve Any Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIR_rxusO8Q):

  - Step 1: Repeat the question. Make sure that you understand the problem.

  - Step 2: Example: get insights by doing and saying examples

  - Step 3: Explain your approach: Come up with your approaches to the problem.

    - Describe the approach: Recursive solution, iterative solution, brute force.

    - Watch out for body language when you are describing your approach, and keep talking about what you are thinking.

  - Step 4: Establish test cases and don't forget to elaborate them throughout the development of your algorithm and code.

  - Step 5: Write your code based on your algorithm and test cases.

    - You could place an asterisk next to a certain line(s) of code that you may not be fully confident in.

  - Step 6: Establish your complexities: Your time and space complexity.

  - Don't start writing as soon as you get the problem. Don't speak in circles, speak clearly and stay calm. You are not meant to answer all of the question perfectly. The goal is to show that you have been exposed to this information.

  - ASK QUESTIONS WHEN YOU ARE STUCK.
